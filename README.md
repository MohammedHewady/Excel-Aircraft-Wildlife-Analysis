# ✈️ Excel Aircraft Wildlife Strikes Analysis (1990–2015)
## 📌 Project Overview
This project is my first data analysis project, and I used professional methods for cleaning, modeling, and visualizing the data. The data set was obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has 174,104 records and 66 attributes. Excel Power Query (for cleaning), Power Pivot (for modeling), and Excel visualization (for dashboards) were used to process the data.

**Main Results**
## General Statistics
 - 174,104 incidents, 2,225 airports, and 533 airlines
 - Average of 14,509 incidents each month
## Trends Over Time 
 - Incidents have been steadily rising, peaking in 2014 
 - Seasonal peak: July–October (highest in August)
## Flight Phases
 - Approach 40.63% (highest risk)
 - Runway for takeoff: 18.48% 
 - Runway for landing: 17.48%
## Weather and visibility
 - 62% of strikes happen during the day and 30% happen at night. 
 - Most strikes happen when the weather is clear (95%).

## Effect on Aircraft
 - Affected parts: windshield, engines, nose, and fuselage
 - 6,145 cautious landings and 2,352 aborted takeoffs
## Airports and Airlines
 - Top airports are Denver (17.24%), Dallas/Fort Worth (15.32%), and Chicago O'Hare (12.58%).
 - Wide range of airlines involved
## Aircraft and Species
 - Top aircraft are the Boeing 737, Airbus A320, and CRJ100/200. 
 - Strikes generally come from unidentified birds, gulls, doves, sparrows, and pigeons
## Engine Effects
 - Engine number 2 was affected in 84.93% of engine-related incidents.

## In conclusion
 - Wildlife strikes are a big danger to aviation safety, especially when aircraft are getting ready to land or take off. Most of them happen during the day and in excellent weather, but they still pose a major threat to engines and windshields.
## Suggestions
  - Improve how large airports handle wildlife hazards
  - Put more effort into prevention during the migration peaks from July to October.
  - Improve aircraft design to reduce vulnerability of engines and windshields
